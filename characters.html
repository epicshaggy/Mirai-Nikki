	<p>The main male protagonist of the series and the First Diary user. Also known as Yuki, he is a 14 year old middle schooler who is a rather quiet boy with an anti-social behavior who doesn't talk much. He mostly sees things around him as a bystander and writes it down in his cell phone diary. Yuki becomes involved in the Diary Game when to his shock that Deus, a god-like being whom he thought was an imaginary friend turns out to be real, selects him as one of twelve contestants in a 90 day battle royale where they must kill each other using their special diaries where the last survivor becomes Deus' new heir. Yuki's diary is called the Random Diary, which written from his point of view, gives a detailed explanation of his surroundings very accurately whether it be the present or the future. While versatile in any situation, the main disadvantage of the Random Diary is that it doesn't tells him what is happening to himself which leaves him vulnerable. Furthermore, since the diary is written from his point of view, Yuki can be tricked into thinking something he sees is true without realizing it which is a disadvantage for other people who use the Random Diary.</p>

	<p>Yuno Gasai is obsessively in love with Yukiteru (Yandere) as one can safely guess from just the simple name of her future diary. Yukiteru's condition and actions are recorded every ten minutes in her "Yukiteru" diary, it also provides small commentary made by Yuno in some of the entries. Its most obvious weakness is that it does not show Yuno's future at all—her condition, situation, or surroundings—unless it somehow involves Yuki. Working with Yukiteru's "Random Diary" diary, however, covers both of their diaries' individual flaws; as it has been said the two make for a perfect combo.</p>

	<p>Takao Hiyama is a teacher in Yuki's school and is the serial killer reported within its vicinity. Not much is known about Takao character-wise, since the man was only given four lines of dialogue in the series, all related with finding and being surprised by Yukiteru. He is the Third diary owner. His "Killer" diary records the location of his next intended victim. It is a handy diary if one knew the true identity of the other diary holders and wishes to take the offensive in the game, but it does little in the way of anything else.</p>

	<p>Keigo Kurusu is a police officer, so it follows with reason that his diary relates to his work. The "Investigation" diary gives Keigo information of future crimes and activities committed anywhere within the prefecture he is assigned to. Whether or not this means his diary can record events that will happen simultaneously in different locations is still up in the air. Its major flaw is a location issue; his diary is rendered useless at predicting anywhere outside his patrolling district.</p>

	<p>Houjou Reisuke is a seemingly harmless 4-year-old child. His parents were killed during the Sacred Eye incident and so he was asked to be taken care of by a co-worker of theirs, Yukiteru's mother Amano Rea.</p>

	</table>
	
	<p>Tsubaki Kasugano is a maiden and figurehead of the Omekata religion. Her "Thousand League Eyes" diary is unlike the other diaries, as it is a scroll, rather than a cell phone. As its name would suggest, it is able to report the future of all her followers. Unlike Yukiteru's diary, it is not limited to just her surroundings, but also sees far events, such as seeing the events Yuki had accomplished a great distance away from where she resides. Her diary can also record near events; the short-term future that will occur after only a few seconds away from the present. This provides Tsubaki with massive amounts of information to work with. However, it can pose as a hindrance in times where a situation changes constantly or when she needs to react quickly.</p>
