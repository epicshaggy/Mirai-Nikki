	<h2>About</h2>
	
	<p>Future Diary (Mirai Nikki) is a Japanese manga series written
	and illustrated by Sakae Esuno. It depicts a battle royale in which
	each combatant has a diary with entries from the future. The manga
	was serialized in the Kadokawa Shoten's Shonen Ace between January
	2006 and December 2010. Twelve tankobon volumes were released in
	Japan. The manga has been licensed by Tokyopop, and ten of the
	English volumes were released, with a release for the last two
	now uncertain due to Tokyopop ceasing publishing in North America.
	A "pilot anime" DVD was released with the 11th manga volume in
	December 2010. A 26-episode anime television series produced by
	Asread aired in Japan between October 2011 and April 2012.
	Funimation has licensed the anime for distribution in North America.
	An 11-episode live-action television drama aired between April and
	June 2012.</p>

	<h2>Sypnosis</h2>
	
	<p>Mirai Nikki is focused around the main character, 15 year-old
	Yukiteru Amano, who is a bit more submissive than your average
	teenager. Yukiteru even has a habit of conversing with imaginary
	friends through his cellphone, in a record he calls his diary.
	Despite Yukiteru's lack of social skills, he inadvertently gets
	thrown into a relationship with Yuno Gasai, a very passionate girl
	of similar age that attends his school. The characters' impending
	collaboration is forced by the take-off of the story's setting
	theme, a survival game.</p>

	<p>Yukiteru and Yuno confront their connection and 
	contemplate working together in the midst of this 
	survival game upon being connected to each other in an interesting 
	and subtlety disturbing way. There are 12 total combatants, 
	including Yukiteru and Yuno. They are all given special diaries 
	that possess unique powers to assist the individual regarding 
	their survival chance. This survival game is conducted and 
	monitored by God himself and the winner shall ascend to his throne, 
	becoming the universe's new one-and-only god. There is but one 
	victor. Who will be this world's champion? Watch as these 
	combatants fight for survival and a chance at godhood.</p>
