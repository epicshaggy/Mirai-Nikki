	<li class="episode">Pin</li>
	
	<p>Yuki and Yuno wreak havoc, demanding that Balks release their friends and commit suicide, by using his position as mayor against him. Balks locks himself in a double-door bank vault in Gasai Bank, which can only be unlocked via retina scan by himself, Yuno's parents or the real Yuno. Since Yuki can no longer eliminate Balks for her, Minene starts hunting Yuki down, reminiscing how she lost her parents in the Middle East as a child and grew up under the constant threat of death. At the same time, Yuno frees Hinata, Mao and Kosaka and goes to kill Kamado, but she is stopped by Aru. In a tense showdown, Minene gains a clear shot at Yuki but sees her child self standing beside him, letting Yuki shoot Minene in the torso. Minene then destroys her diary voluntarily in order to detonate a bomb triggered by her death, intending to destroy the vault for Yuki, yet the vault withstands the blast. Yuno arrives to send Yuki away to destroy HOLON, and she somehow manages to open the vault and kill Balks. A few days later, Aru expresses his distrust in Yuno to Kamado, Hinata, Mao and Kosaka after he witnessed her opening the vault via retina scan despite being an impostor, while Yuki shows Yuno his list of the deceased Future Diary Holders. Suddenly, dark vortexes appear all over the city due to Deus's lifespan decaying. While Murmur is panicking over the world ending sooner than expected, Kamado appears with Aru, who asks Deus if Yuki could return the world back to normal if he was the successor.</p>
	
	<li class="episode">Disconnection</li>
	
	<p>A shocked Aru attempts to inform Yuki of Deus's answer, but Deus stops Aru, revealing that Aru is an entity created by him to observe and record information on the survival game and its players. Deus starts disassembling Aru, promising to spare him if he proves he has done anything out of his own free will, but Aru succeeds when he reveals he had Kamado make his cellphone into an apprentice detective diary, demonstrating his will to change the future and save Yuki. Yuno asks Yuki if he has the will to kill his friends if they end up betraying him. As they arrive at Aru's apartment to kill Kamado, Yuno is held off by Aru while Yuki chases after Kamado and his friends. When he runs into Hinata, he learns that Deus told Aru that the divine power bestowed to the winner of the survival game can bring bodies back from the dead but not the soul. Meanwhile, Yuno stabs herself, since Aru countered all of her attacks. After Aru patches up Yuno's wound, he rushes to the scene. Yuno calls Yuki to prevent Aru from contacting him and tells him that Aru tried to kill her and that he should not trust any of his friends. Out of rage and fear, Yuki ends up shooting Hinata, Mao and Kosaka, still believing he can bring them back to life after he becomes a god. Aru finally arrives and warns Yuki that Yuno plans on killing him at the very end to win the game. When Yuno arrives, Aru kisses Yuki, enthralling Yuno. Aru and Yuno commence fighting and Aru manages to smash her cellphone, but Yuno pulls out a second cellphone and slashes at Aru's throat. As Yuno kills Kamado, a dying Aru, who knows the first diary he destroyed was real, suddenly has an epiphany about Yuno. Since he can no longer talk, he writes a message in his phone and shows it to Yuki, allowing Yuno to finish him off as Deus begins to collapse.</p>
	
	<li class="episode">Breach of Contract</li>
	
	<p>It's three days till the end of the world. Yuki tries to figure out Yuno's motives, and debates giving her the Happy End she's been after all this time. But that might not be enough for Murmur, she wants things interesting...</p>
	
	<li class="episode">Data Retrieval</li>
	
	<p>As the Cathedral of Causality raises, Yuno expresses her disgust at how this state of affairs prevents her and Yuki from ever surviving together. She states that since Yuki will not kill her, she will kill him and travel back in time again to meet another Yuki. Murmur shoves Yuki off a cliff, but he is saved by the sudden reappearance of Minene, who displays powers similar to that of Murmur. As Murmur and Yuno travel two years back in time to a "Third World", Minene and Yuki follow them. Minene explains to Yuki that when Deus realized Murmur was favoring Yuno, he suspected them of being from another timeline. In order to ensure the fair running of the game, he imparted Minene with part of his power, although she did not know so at the time. Knowing that Yuno intends to kill her past self in this world as well, Yuki rushes to her house with Minene. When Yuki finds the Third World Yuno abused and locked in a cage, choking on a mat she tried to eat, he calls for an ambulance, despite Minene's warnings about interfering with the past. As Yuno and Murmur arrive with the Third World Rea and Kurou hostage, Minene and Yuki flee with the Third World Yuno in tow, while Minene lectures Yuki that the parents in the Third World aren't his.</p>
	
	<li class="episode">Reset</li>
	
	<p>Yuki decides who he has to save. Yuno decides who she has to kill. Minene keeps her promises. And Murmur... There is even more to Murmur than anyone knew. And the fate of more than one world lays in the balance.</p>
	
	<li class="episode">Initialization</li>
	
	<p>After some hesitation at seeing the innocence of her Third World self, Yuno lunges at her, but she is stopped by her Third World parents. As the police arrived, Keigo confronts Yuno, and Nishijima rescues Minene. Meanwhile, the actions of Yuki and Minene have caused a domino effect that has changed the future of almost every Future Diary Holder for the better: Tsubaki learns that Funatsu, her cult subordinate, was caught placing a bomb in her parents' car, preventing Tsubaki and Reisuke from having horrible lives. Yomotsu captures Takao, saving victims Takao would've killed. Hinata and Karyuudo resolve their relationship. Kamado receives more funding for her orphanage, while Marco and Ai hears from Orin that the orphanage is safe. When Balks's incomplete diary reads the results in Yuki's diary, he calls off his partnership with Deus, who decides to cancel the survival game and find another method to determine his successor. Yuki manages to remember Yuno and break free from the illusionary world, while in the process of releasing the Second World Murmur, who had been trapped by her First World self in order to impersonate her. Faced with Yuki's love and her Third World self's united family, Yuno's resolve to kill them all is lost, and she decides to commit suicide. A horrified Yuki is declared winner of the survival game by the Second World Murmur and is spirited away through a vortex. In the Third World, all Future Diary Holders are enjoying their new and peaceful lives. As many millennia pass in the Second World, Yuki is still grieving Yuno's death in his now empty universe, refusing to create anything as its god. Murmur tries to comfort him, but to no avail, since he just keeps staring at the last entry of his phone. However, the last entry changes and indicates that Yuno is somehow still alive.</p>
	
	<li class="episode">OVA: Redial</li>
	
	<p>The episode opens near the events of the First World Yuno committing suicide and Yuki being crowned winner of the survival game in the Second World. The First World Murmur tries to preserve the game by storing all the memories of the First world Yuno into a gem and consuming but is caught and imprisoned by the Third World Murmur. The Third World Yuno, her parents and Keigo watch in bewilderment. In the Third World, two years after the incident, Yuno has gained a better relationship with her family and is on a summer trip with her friends, whilst Deus is contemplating how to decide a new god. In the Cathedral of Casualty, Deus tries to convince Minene to become the next goddess, fearing the Third World will become like the First World, but she declines. Balks is able to contact Deus repeatedly, much to his disdain as he keeps suggesting new game ideas, but is usually sent back before getting to finish. Aru is an observer for Deus and does so without rebellion. Running out of options, Deus contemplates letting the world just end, despite Murmur's protests. The other previous Future Diary Holders lead normal lives. Yuno has become friends with Hinata, Mao and Kosaka. Yomotsu runs a gift shop dedicated to his secret alter ego. The Second World Minene is married to Nishijima, although still having her powers. Tsubaki tries to get close to Aru, with Reisuke as his detective-in-training. However, Yuno feels like she is forgetting something important. Later one night on July 27th, Yuno hears a voice in her head and is teleported into Deus's realm with a desire to meet someone. With assistance from Minene and later Aru, who has memories of his Second World self, and lack of interference from Deus, Yuno makes it to a central tower and finds the First World Murmur, who had taken on the memories of the Second World Yuno before her capture and feels that Yuno deserves to know what she cannot remember. Deus states that the bond between Yuki and Yuno is strong enough to continue in all three separate worlds. As Yuno gains the memories of her other self, she is chosen as the goddess of the Third World, creating a pathway to the Second World and finally reuniting with Yuki. Yuno enters at the point where Yuki's future in his phone changes. Minene, Deus and all three Murmurs watch as the two embrace, with Yuno bringing up Yuki's promise to stargaze with her.</p>
