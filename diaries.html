	<p>The main male protagonist of the series and the First Diary user. Also known as Yuki, he is a 14 year old middle schooler who is a rather quiet boy with an anti-social behavior who doesn't talk much. He mostly sees things around him as a bystander and writes it down in his cell phone diary. Yuki becomes involved in the Diary Game when to his shock that Deus, a god-like being whom he thought was an imaginary friend turns out to be real, selects him as one of twelve contestants in a 90 day battle royale where they must kill each other using their special diaries where the last survivor becomes Deus' new heir. Yuki's diary is called the Random Diary, which written from his point of view, gives a detailed explanation of his surroundings very accurately whether it be the present or the future. While versatile in any situation, the main disadvantage of the Random Diary is that it doesn't tells him what is happening to himself which leaves him vulnerable. Furthermore, since the diary is written from his point of view, Yuki can be tricked into thinking something he sees is true without realizing it which is a disadvantage for other people who use the Random Diary.</p>

	<p>Yuno Gasai is obsessively in love with Yukiteru (Yandere) as one can safely guess from just the simple name of her future diary. Yukiteru's condition and actions are recorded every ten minutes in her "Yukiteru" diary, it also provides small commentary made by Yuno in some of the entries. Its most obvious weakness is that it does not show Yuno's future at all—her condition, situation, or surroundings—unless it somehow involves Yuki. Working with Yukiteru's "Random Diary" diary, however, covers both of their diaries' individual flaws; as it has been said the two make for a perfect combo.</p>

	<p>Takao Hiyama is a teacher in Yuki's school and is the serial killer reported within its vicinity. Not much is known about Takao character-wise, since the man was only given four lines of dialogue in the series, all related with finding and being surprised by Yukiteru. He is the Third diary owner. His "Killer" diary records the location of his next intended victim. It is a handy diary if one knew the true identity of the other diary holders and wishes to take the offensive in the game, but it does little in the way of anything else.</p>

	<p>Keigo Kurusu is a police officer, so it follows with reason that his diary relates to his work. The "Investigation" diary gives Keigo information of future crimes and activities committed anywhere within the prefecture he is assigned to. Whether or not this means his diary can record events that will happen simultaneously in different locations is still up in the air. Its major flaw is a location issue; his diary is rendered useless at predicting anywhere outside his patrolling district.</p>

	<p>Tsubaki Kasugano is a maiden and figurehead of the Omekata religion. Her "Thousand League Eyes" diary is unlike the other diaries, as it is a scroll, rather than a cell phone. As its name would suggest, it is able to report the future of all her followers. Unlike Yukiteru's diary, it is not limited to just her surroundings, but also sees far events, such as seeing the events Yuki had accomplished a great distance away from where she resides. Her diary can also record near events; the short-term future that will occur after only a few seconds away from the present. This provides Tsubaki with massive amounts of information to work with. However, it can pose as a hindrance in times where a situation changes constantly or when she needs to react quickly.</p>

	<p>Fourteen years ago, the orphaned Marco had been taken in at some point by Kamado Ueshita, who would become the Eighth diary owner. Whilst visiting the Sakurami observation tower, Marco met the young Ai who had been abandoned by her parents that day. Marco told Ai if she believed that day to be the worst day of her life, than the next day would be better. Marco then invited Ai to live with him and Kamado at the Mother's Village orphanage.</p>
	<p>Fourteen years ago, Ai was abandoned by her parents at the Sakurami Tower and was told to wait for them to return. By sunset, Ai realised her parents had gone and cursed the day as being the worst of her life. It was at this point that Marco approached her for the first time, having observed her for most of the day. He told her that if that day was her worst day, than the next day would be better. Marco invites Ai to come live with him in Mother's Village, the orphanage of Kamado Ueshita, who would become the Eighth diary owner. Ai accepted.</p>

	<p>Minene Uryuu is a terrorist bomber. Like the Fourth, her "Escape" diary goes along with the type of profession she is involved in. Whenever Minene faces a dire situation, the diary will chart out the best course of actions she can take in order to get out of a tight spot. Based on the function of her diary, it might even help reduce the chances of her receiving a Dead End and it is probably one of the best diaries to have in Deus' game of survival. The diary's only shortcoming is that there are some circumstances where the odds are too heavily stacked against Minene to the point where the diary won't be able to secure an escape route for her.</p>

He also owns a large computer mainframe which he uses during his planned attack against Yukiteru Amano and his friends. Which reveals both his technological expertise and the mastery he has over his dogs.</p>

	<p>John, wishing to evolve humanity to new heights, met and approached Deus with the proposal to give mankind some of his divine power. His concept was the Future Diaries, which could predict the future. Learning of Deus' approaching demise, John's idea would contribute to the survival game Deus had in mind to choose a successor. Deus used his powers to help create the powers of the Future Diaries, whilst John developed the actual technology. The two made several archetypal prototypes to test out the powers of the diaries - The "Radar" Diary, which could predict a person's surroundings; the "Searcher Diary" which predicts the actions of certain individuals; the "Organizer" Diary which predicts the actions of groups; and the "Supplier" which gives others the power to predict the future.</p>

	<p>Yomotsu Hirasaka is a blind man who makes use of a tape recorder that he dubs the "Justice" diary, where it records the wrong-doings of future events he thinks need correcting. It's a pretty misleading name since Yomotsu considers the evil deeds committed by a religion cult as much of an injustice as finding random trash on the floor. His diary's actual functions are actually similar to the Sixth's "Thousand League Eyes," but rather it's the "Thousand League Hearing." He is able to create illusions using hypnosis granted by his diary.</p>
